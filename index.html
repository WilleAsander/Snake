            This is a variation of the classic game snake. The goal is to get as high of a score as possible. Every fifth food you collect takes you to the next level
            where the speed at which you travel. This version adds a timer that when depleted moves the food to another location on the map. It also adds black obstacles that makes you
            lose if you hit them.

            The game is run on heroku and it uses Node and express to run the server.
